# Technical Overview

## Architecture

This solution uses Azure Functions to manage IP blocklists in Azure Firewall. The main components are:

1. Azure Function App (PowerShell)
2. Azure Firewall and Firewall Policy
3. IP Groups for efficient IP management
4. Service Principal for authentication

## Function Implementation

The function implements three main actions:

### 1. Test Action
- Verifies configuration
- Checks connectivity to Azure resources
- Validates environment variables

### 2. Update Action
1. Fetches IPs from configured blocklist URL
2. Validates IP addresses
3. Updates IP Group with new addresses
4. Ensures rule collection exists and is properly configured

### 3. Unblock Action
1. Accepts comma-separated list of IPs
2. Removes specified IPs from current blocklist
3. Updates IP Group with remaining IPs

## Authentication Flow

1. Service Principal credentials stored in app settings
2. Connect-AzAccount used for Azure authentication
3. Custom role ensures least-privilege access

## Error Handling

The function implements comprehensive error handling:
1. Input validation
2. Network request handling
3. Azure API error handling
4. Configuration validation

## Monitoring

Metrics are exposed through Azure Monitor:
- Function execution time
- Success/failure rates
- IP count processing

## Security Considerations

1. Function-level authentication required
2. Service Principal uses minimal permissions
3. All sensitive data stored in app settings
4. Network-level isolation available through VNET integration

## Performance Optimization

1. IP Groups used for efficient management
2. Batch processing for large IP lists
3. Retry logic for transient failures
4. Caching of Azure context when possible

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:
1. Review logs for errors
2. Monitor IP Group capacity
3. Rotate service principal credentials
4. Update PowerShell modules
